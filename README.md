# About the blog
This is my personal blog, created to gather all my problems I've faced and took
me some effort to solve, just for documentation purposes, and something to go
back to when ever I face the same problem again, also tricks I found useful, or
what I think is a good practice in a certain condition.

# Contribution
If you've found a typo, or a mistake in my blog, all pr's are welcome, I would
just ask to follow my single rule which is sticking with an 80 character max
line width.
